# 2) before binding this Ms with the account public address we need to check that:
# 2.1) Ms != RNS(0)
# 2.2) there is no other Ms binded with this account
# 3) finally bind the Ms with this account on the blockchain

# transaction verification procedure
# TODO: prevent underflow

# 1) M1s and M2s exists
# 2) M2s*(cb1 - cbn1)^2 == M1s*(cb2 - cbn2)^2
